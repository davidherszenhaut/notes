# notes
## the present continuous form
- the present continuous form ("-ing") is made with the 「て」 form + 「いる」
- this 「いる」 conjugates like an ichidan verb (for changing tense or adding 「ます」, for example)
## results of change
- this is formed with the same construction as the present continuous, but is used to described a continued state of being (ex: getting married and continuing to exist in the state of being married)
- 「行っている」 means "has gone and is still there"
- 「来ている」 means "came and is still here"
## the 「て」 form for adjectives and nouns
- for adjectives, replace 「い」 with 「くて」
- for nouns, add 「で」
## saying "go and do"
- location + 「に」 + 「ます」 stem + 「に」 + 「行く・来る・帰る」
