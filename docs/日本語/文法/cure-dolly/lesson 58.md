# notes
- the five main logical particles (「が」, 「を」, 「に」, 「へ」, and 「で」) cannot be "combined" with one another
	- these particles specify the function of their noun and nouns cannot be more than one part of speech at a time
- the two primary logical particles (「が」 and 「を」) do not combine with the non-logical particles
	- in any directly transitive sentence, both of these particles are there (even if not visible)
- particle combinations do not create any new meaning, they just use the function of both particles at the same time
- ex: 「０が冬には雪だるまを作る」 means "as for in-winter, (I) make snowman"
	- 「には」 marks 「冬」 as when something is done, but also marks/contrasts it as the topic
- ex: 「０が秋にも雪だるまを作る」 means "as for in-fall-also, (I) make snowman"
- the nominalizing 「の」 particle can be used with any logical particle because it turns the thing before it into a noun (and nouns can be used with any logical particle)
	- ex: 「田中さんと一緒に泳ぐのが好きだ。」 means "The thing of going swimming with Tanaka-san is likable."
