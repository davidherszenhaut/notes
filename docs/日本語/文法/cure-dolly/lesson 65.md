# notes
- 「行く」 means "to go (from where to speaker is to somewhere else)"
- 「来る」 means "to come (from somewhere else to where the speaker is)"
- 「行く」 can refer to going from the speaker's location to another location or from one location away from the speaker to another location away from the speaker
	- 「行く」 can represent movement that does not involve the speaker (can be more objective than 「来る」 in this way)
- 「来る」 can only refer to going towards the speaker's location
- ex: 「雨が降ってきた。」
	- this uses a time expression to state that rain has come to the present time
	- attached helper verbs tend to not use kanji
- ex: 「だんだん雨が降っていく。」
	- this uses a time expression to state that the rain will increase in the future
- the above examples use 「行く」 and 「来る」 to describe a continuing process
- ex: 「勉強すれば、だんだん数学が分かってくる。」 means "If you study, math will gradually come to be understandable to you."
- ex: 「寒くなってきた。」 versus 「寒くなって行った。」
	- the first sentence implies that the cold is affecting the speaker subjectively
	- the second sentence more objectively implies movement without mentioning the speaker
