# notes
- the conditional と is the same as the exhaustive list と
- this と is non-logical so it can attach to nouns and logical clauses
- 「冬になると寒くなる。」 means "When/If it becomes winter, it gets cold."
	- this sentence uses the exhaustive list と because it means that only one result can follow
- this と can also be used in a hyperbolic fashion
	- ex: 「それを食べると病気になる。」 does not mean with 100% certainty that the sickness will happen
- this と can also be used to say that something is necessary
	- ex: 「行かないとダメ。」 means "If don't go, will be bad."
	- ex: 「勉強しないといけない。」 means "If don't study, can't go (won't do)."
