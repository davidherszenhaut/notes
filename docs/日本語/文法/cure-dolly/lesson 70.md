# notes
- 「かかる」 is the self-move version and 「かける」 is the other-move version
## 「かける」
- not exactly the same meaning as "to hang" or "to hook"
	- ex: 「かける」 would be used in place of "put" in the phrase "put a blanket over" and in place of "wearing" in the phrase "wearing a necklace"
- has a connotation of putting something on something else in a way where it will not be easily removed
## 「掛かる」
- ex: 「時間がかかる。」 means "Time hangs."
- ex: 「日本語を覚えるのに時間がかかる。」 means "To/on learning Japanese, time hangs (is taken up)."
