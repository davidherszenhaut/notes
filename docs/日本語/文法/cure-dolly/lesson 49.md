# notes
- 「あげる」 means "to give (upward to someone else)"
- 「くれる」 means "to give (downward to us)"
- 「〜てあげる」 and 「〜てくれる」 are used for give actions
- 「あげる」 and 「くれる」 are _not_ 「敬語」
- 「もらう」 does not imply a giver for the direct object (unlike 「あげる」 and 「くれる」 which have specific givers and receivers)
- 「くれる」 implies that the giver took the initiative
- 「もらう」 implies that the receiver took the initiative
- if a giver is specified when using 「もらう」, they are marked by 「に」
- one weird way to think about these three verbs
	- 「あげる」 is an upload (to an other)
	- 「くれる」 is a (push) download
	- 「もらう」 is a (pull) download
- ex: 「０がお医者さんに見てもらう。」 means "(I) will have a doctor see me."
- the person receiving the action of 「もらう」 does not have to be the speaker (unlike 「くれる」)
