# notes
- the causative helper verb (「せる」/「させる」) does not necessarily mean "compel" or "allow", it just means "cause (by any means)"
- ex: 「知らせる」 means "to cause to know" and is similar to "let me know" in meaning
- ex: 「聞かせてもらえますか。」 means "Is it possible to receiving your causing me to hear, please?"
	- 「聞か」 means "hear"
	- 「せて」 means "cause"
	- 「もら」 means "receive"
	- 「え」 means "possible"
	- 「ます」 means "formal"
	- 「か」 means "question"
- ex: 「学生でも下宿させてもらえませんか。」 means "Even if one is a student, is it not possible to receive being caused to lodge here?"
- 「頂く」 is the 敬語 form of 「もらう」
