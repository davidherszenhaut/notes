# notes
## the copula 「だ」
- understanding 「だ」 is important for understanding "noun + copula" ending sentences ("A is B" sentences)
- 「だ」 is sometimes dropped in casual speech, but is still "necessary" to be grammatically correct
- unlike the three sentence engines, nouns, particles, and conjunctions do not change form (e.g., 「高い」 becoming 「高かった」 or 「だ」 becoming 「だった」)
- 「だ」 has several forms
	- 「だ」 - regular form
	- 「で」 - 「て」 form
	- 「です」 - formal-polite form
	- 「な」 - pre-connective form
	- 「でございます」 - formal-very-respective form
	- 「である」 - formal-objective form (not necessarily polite)
	- and more...
- 「です」 and 「でございます」 can be added to sentences ending with an adjective, but they are purely politeness markers and not functioning as a copula
- 「だ」 is not just used with adjectives
	- ex: 「無事*で*よかった。」 means "*That (you) were* safe was good."
	- ex: 「僕はウサギ*な*のですよ。」 means "It *is* that I am a rabbit."
## "conjugation"
- what are usually referred to as conjugations are just helpers attached to verb stems
