# notes
- some Japanese verbs can only be translated to English using the passive voice even though that is not exactly what is happening in Japanese
	- ex: 「乱れる」 means "to do (the state of) disordered"
	- ex: 「欠ける」 means "to do (the state of) lacking"
- there are Japanese verbs that get translated as "becoming" verbs in English
	- ex: 「濡れる」 means "to do (the state of) wet"
	- ex: 「濁る」 means "to do (the state of) cloudy/muddy"
