# notes
- the potential form is made by using the え stem of a godan verb and adding the 「る」 potential helper verb (or adding 「られる」 to the base for ichidan verbs)
	- the potential form is usually "self-move"
	- the potential form can be "other-move" in modifying clauses
- 「見る」 (dictionary form)
	- 「見られる」 (regular potential form)
		- usually refers to having the opportunity to see something
		- 「見れる」 uses the practice of 「ら抜き」 (removing the 「ら」)
	- 「見える」 (irregular potential form)
		- usually refers to being physically able to see something
		- can also be used to say that something "looks like" something
			- ex: 「彼はカエルに見える。」 means "He looks like a frog."
- 「聞く」 (dictionary form)
	- 「聞ける」 (regular potential form)
	- 「聞こえる」 (irregular potential form)
		- can be used to say that something "sounds like" something
			- ex: 「０が奇妙に聞こえる。」 means "(It) sounds strange."
