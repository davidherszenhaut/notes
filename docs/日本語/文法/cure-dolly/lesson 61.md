# notes
- Japanese sentences always have a subject (「が」) and a topic (「は」), even if they are not always explicitly stated
- 「は」 versus 「が」 is not about deciding what the topic or subject is (that is already known), but about what aspect to emphasize
- 「は」 should be used to mark "old" or "known" information
	- ex: "I fed _the_ dog. (Which dog?)" versus "I fed _a_ dog. (Any dog works.)"
- 「は」 and 「が」 can have different implications
	- ex: 「本を買った。」 (means "I bought a book." because 「０が」 defaults to "I")
		- "I" is the subject and the topic
		- neutral statement
	- ex: 「私は本を買った。」
		- 「私」 is the "old" information and 「本を買った」 is the "new" information
		- 「は」 makes a distinction by either defining or changing the topic of conversation
		- 「は」 also implies that the comment on the new topic is different from the comment on the old topic
		- answers the question "What did you do?" ("As for me, I bought a book.)
	- ex: 「私が本を買った。」
		- 「私」 is the "new" information and 「本を買った」 is the "old" information
		- 「が」 emphasizes that "_I_ bought the book."
		- answers the question "Who bought the book?" ("_I_ bought the book.")
- 「は」 and 「が」 can be used to differentiate between generalities and specificities
	- ex: 「花は綺麗だ。」 is more likely to mean flowers in general
	- ex: 「花が綺麗だ。」 is more likely to mean particular flowers
- ex: 「雨が降っている。」 means "Rain is falling."
- ex: 「雨は降っている。」 means "Rain is falling (with an implication that if rain were not the topic, that thing would not be falling)."
- using 「は」 emphasizes the comment following the topic
