# notes
- ex: 「各団体には私からよく説明しておく。」 means "I will give each group a good explanation from me."
	- 「ておく」 is used to say that the explanation will be given for some purpose (putting the action in place)
	- using 「てしまう」 here would have a different implication
- Japanese tends to use helper verbs in places where prepositions would be used in English
