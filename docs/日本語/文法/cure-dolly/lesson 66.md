# notes
- logical clauses can end in one of two ways:
	- with a full stop (marking the end of the sentence)
	- with a conjunction (marking it as a logical clause within a compound sentence)
- when a logical clause is directly followed by a noun, that clause is modifying that noun
- 「東京オリンピック選手が食べる料理をみんなに教えてもらう。」
	- 「東京オリンピック選手が食べる」 is modifying 「料理」
	- this sentence has an undefined 「０が」
		- similar to using "they" in English to refer to some unidentified person or group
