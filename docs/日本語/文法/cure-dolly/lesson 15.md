# notes
- verbs are "move words"
- a "self move word" is a verb that moves itself (ex: standing up)
- an "other move word" is a verb that moves something else (ex: throwing a ball)
- japanese has a lot of self-move/other-move pairs
	- ex: 「出る」 which means "to leave" and 「出す」 which means "to take (something) out"
	- ex: 「負ける」 which means "to lose" and 「まかす」 which mean "to cause (someone) to lose"
- 「ある」 is the main self-move verb
- 「する」 is the main other-move verb
- there are guidelines to distinguish between these pairs
	- if one of the pair ends in す (or せる), it is the other-move word
	- if one of the pair end in the あ stem + ある, it is the self-move word
	- taking a verbs う stem ending and changing it to the え stem + る flips the self-move/other-move status
		- (む -> める), (ぶ -> べる), and (つ -> てる) are always the other-move words
	- exceptions not covered by these guidelines:
		- (く/ぐ -> ける/げる), (う -> える), and る-ending verbs not covered by the first two guidelines
