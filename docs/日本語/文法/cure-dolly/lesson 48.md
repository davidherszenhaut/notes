# notes
## context
- the 0 pronoun similar to "it" in English
- it has no meaning without context
- the 0 pronoun can lead to ambiguity, but so can "it"
## probability
- if two options are possible and context does not specify, go with what is most likely
## the absurdity rule
- assume that a sentence is not absurd unless the absurdity appears to be intentional
