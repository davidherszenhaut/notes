# notes
- every japanese sentence has two components:
	- a "carriage" car, A
	- an "engine" car, B
- there are two types of sentences:
	- A is B (ex: サクラが日本人だ。)
	- A does B (ex: サクラが歩く。)
- が is the center of japanese grammar, even if it is not explicitly part of a sentence
	- が links the A and B components
- sentences ending with an i-adjective do not need a だ because the い takes the function of だ (ex: ペンが赤い。)
	- these types of sentences are part of the "A is B" type
