# notes
- a copula is something that links A to B ("A is B"), but not necessarily B to A
- a copula assigns item A to set B
- 「です」 is usually a copula except when used with sentences ending in an adjective (in this case, it is a politeness marker)
	- the 「い」 at the end of plain adjectives carries the function of the copula so adding it is redundant
