# notes
- for たら, just add ら to the past tense た or だ form of a verb or adjective
	- たら is the only conditional that can be used for past events
	- shows that the past event was unexpected or surprising
	- ex: 「家に帰ったら彼がいた。」 means "When I returned home, he was there (and I was surprised to find him there)."
	- たら can also be used as a true conditional statement about future events
		- tends to emphasize what will happen if the condition is fulfilled (as opposed to れば which puts more emphasis on whether or not the condition will be fulfilled)
- for なら, just put it after nouns or logical clauses
	- can be used with present or future conditions that are not in doubt
	- ex: 「彼なら、出来る。」 means "Since it's him we're talking about, it's possible."
