# notes
- 「こと」 can be used to describe "the thing" of something or someone
- ex: 「０は私のことが嫌いらしい。」 means "My 「こと」 seems dislikable."
	- this construction could be related to not wanting to directly state what someone else is feeling
- ex: 「どういうこと？」 means "What kind of 「こと」?"
	- tends to imply that a stronger explanation is being asked for compared to 「どんなこと？」
- 「そんな」 can be used similarly
	- usually expresses a negative reaction (like denial or disappointment)
