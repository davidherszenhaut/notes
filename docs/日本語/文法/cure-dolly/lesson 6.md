# notes
- Japanese sentences have three fundamental types depending on their engine:
	- う, verb sentences (A does B)
	- だ, noun sentences (A is B)
	- い, adjective sentences (A is B)
- all of these three types of engines can be used as an adjective
## verbs as adjectives
- any verb in any tense can be used like an adjective
	- ex: 「人が歌った。」 means "Person sang." and 「歌った人が寝ている。」 means "Person who sang is sleeping."
	- entire verbs sentences can be adjectival
	- ex: 「辞書を食べた犬がヤンチャだ。」 means "Dog who ate the dictionary is bad."
## nouns as adjectives
- when using a noun as an adjective, use な as it is the connective form of だ
	- ex: 「ヤンチャな犬が寝ている。」 means "Dog who is bad is sleeping."
- not all nouns are adjectival
## the の particle
- the の particle is the possessive particle
- the の particle works like "'s" in English
	- ex: 「私の靴」 means "my shoes"
- the の particle can be used to describe things that belong to a group
	- ex: 「ピンク色」 means "pink color" but cannot be used as an i-adjective or a na-adjective, so use 「ピンク色の物」 instead to describe a pink thing
