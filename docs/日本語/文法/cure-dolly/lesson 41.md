# notes
## nearly all Japanese words fall into one of three categories
- the categories are: nouns, verbs, and adjectives
- other word types include particles and conjunctions
## verbs and adjectives are easy to identify
- every verb ends in an う row kana (in its "dictionary" form)
- every adjective ends in the kana い (in its "dictionary" form)
- basically every other word is a noun
- if a word is (or can be) written in only kanji, it is very likely to be a noun
## there are special types of nouns
- adjectival nouns
	- these are nouns that (under certain conditions) can be used adjectivally
	- can use the connective form of the copula 「だ」 (「な」)
- 「する」 nouns
	- these are nouns that can be used with 「する」 and drop the direct object marker 「を」
	- ex: 「勉強をする」 means "do study" and 「勉強する」 means "to study"
- adverbial nouns
	- like 「する」 nouns, they can drop particles (「と」 and 「に」)under certain conditions
	- ex: 「静か」 means "quiet" and 「静かに（する）」 means "(do) quietly"
	- adverbial nouns can drop this 「に」
		- ex: 「ゆっくり」 means "slow" and 「ゆっくり（する）」 means "(do) slowly"
		- ex: 「あまり」 means "excess" and 「悲しみのあまり泣いた。」 means "From sadness's excess, cried."
			- ex: 「あまり勉強しない。」 means "Not do an excess of study."
	- ex: 「随分上手だね。」 means "You're pretty skilled, huh."
