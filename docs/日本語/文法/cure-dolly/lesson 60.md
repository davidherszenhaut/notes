# notes
- logical structure is "A car, B engine"
- non-logical structure is "topic, comment"
- there is a 「０は」 that exists like 「０が」
	- ex: 「０はコーヒーが好きだ。」
	- ex: 「０は頭が痛い。」
	- ex: 「０はお腹が空いた。」
	- ex: 「０はクレープが食べたい。」
	- the 「０は」 in these examples can be assumed to be "As for me"
- the comment is always a complete logical clause
	- 「は」 can never mark the A car, B engine, or any other logical part of the sentence
	- since a sentence needs an A car and B engine, they must exist outside of the topic
- the choice between 「は」 and 「が」 is choosing which ever-present element should be made visible and emphasized
