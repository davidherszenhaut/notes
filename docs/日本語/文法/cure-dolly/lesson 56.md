# notes
- non-agile expressions are used carefully and have to be the main point
- agile expressions are used freely and can be used in passing
## the agility of the 「は」 (topic marking )particle
- the 「は」 particle is quick way of marking the topic of conversation
- ex: 「アフリカはライオンはいるがトラはいない」 has three topic markers
	- what follows a 「は」-marked topic has to be a logical clause
	- there are two logical clauses in this sentence, each with their own (sub)topic:
		- 「ライオンは０がいる」 and 「トラは０がいない」
		- 「は」 is used to distinguish between the topics
## the agility of the (nominalizing) 「の」 particle
- the nominalizing 「の」 particles acts as a pronoun and bundles everything before it into a noun-like entity
- ex: 「朝のパリに響くのは鐘だよ」
	- the topic is 「朝のパイに響くの」 ("that which reverberates in morning Paris")
	- the core of the sentence is 「０が鐘だ(よ)」 ("they are bells")
