# notes
- most of the time, the japanese non-past tense refers to future events
## the present tense
- to say that something or someone is currently doing something, use 「いる」
	- ex: 「サクラが歩いている。」 means "Sakura is walking."
	- ex: 「犬が食べている。」 means "The dog is eating."
	- in these sentences, 「いる」 is the B car and 「歩く」/「食べる」 are modifying 「いる」
## the past tense
- add 「た」 to verbs to make them past tense
- 「た」 attaches the same way as 「て」
## time expressions
- relative time expressions (ex: 「明日」 or 「昨日」) placed at the beginning of a sentence do not require a particle
- absolute time expressions (ex: 「火曜日」 or 「六時」) use the に particle to mark when something takes place
	- に is needed when "on", "at", or "in" would be used in english
