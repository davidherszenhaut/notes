# notes
- the "A car/B engine" dynamic applies to sentences and logical clauses
- a logical clause is a complete sentence (it can grammatically stand on its own), but a sentence can contain more than one logical clause
	- ex: 「０がお店に行ってパンを買った。」 is made up of two logical clauses (「０がお店に行った。」 and 「０がパンを買った。」)
- in an "A does B" sentence, the nouns marked by the main logical particles (other than 「が」 and 「の」) are all modifiers for the verb
- 「０が」 cannot be modified
