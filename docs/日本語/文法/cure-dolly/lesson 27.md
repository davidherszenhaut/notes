# notes
- 「ばかり」 means "just" or "nothing but"
- one common usage is with a past tense sentence to say that something has "just" taken place
- another common usage is to state that there is a large quantity of something ("there is nothing but")
	- using 「ばかり」 after the て form of a verb means doing nothing but that verb
- 「ばかり」 can also be used to make conjunctions
	- ex: 「０が歌ったばかりか踊った。」 means "Not only sang, but also danced."
- 「ばかりに」 can be used to explain why something happened
	- unlike 「から」 or 「ので」, this implies that something happened only because of something else
