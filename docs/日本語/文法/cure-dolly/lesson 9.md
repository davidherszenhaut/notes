# notes
## notes on は and が
- 「私はコーヒが好きだ。」
	- this does not mean "I like coffee."
	- 「コーヒ」 is the word marked by が, not 「私」
	- the core of the sentence is "Coffee is likable."
	- 「私は」 just tells in what case "coffee is likable" ("As for me, ...")
## expressing want
- use 「欲しい」 to express that something is wanted
	- 「食べ物が欲しい。」 translates to "Food is wanted."
- use the い stem and the helper adjective 「たい」 to express wanting to do something
	- ex: 「クレープが食べたい。」 roughly translates to "Crepes are want-inducing."
	- ex: 「０が食べたい。」 means "(I am) wanting to eat."
- these expressions should only be used when talking about oneself, not others, because you cannot know for sure what someone else is feeling
	- to talk about someone else, remove the い and add the helper adjective 「がる」 (to show signs of)
	- ex: 「彼がケーキを欲しがる。」 means "He is showing signs of wanting cake."
