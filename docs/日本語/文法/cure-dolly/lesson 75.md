# notes
- the 「０」 pronoun replaces the function of "it"
	- 「０」 can also be used in place of "I" and "you" very frequently (depending on context)
	- 「０」 is also more commonly used than 「彼」 and 「彼女」
- using 「あなた」 is not recommended (considered more rude than not using the 「です」 and 「ます」 decorators)
- ex: 「田中さんとその犬」 means "Tanaka-san and his dog"
	- this 「その犬」 does not mean "that dog", it means "a dog related to Tanaka-san"
- constructions like 「てくれる」 and 「てやる」 can give information about what people are doing without explicitly using their names or pronouns because the actions happen in a certain "direction"
