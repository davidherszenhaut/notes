# notes
- adjectives ending in 「しい」 on the whole express subjectivities
## helper adjective 「らしい」
- can be attached to a word or logical clause like 「そう」
	- if placed after a word, it describes the subjective representation of the thing represented by that word
	- if placed after a word, it indicates that the statement itself is a subjectivity ("seems to be")
- does not always mean "this seems to be", could also mean "this is similar to"
## differences from 「そう」
- 「あの動物はウサギだそうだ。」 means "I heard that that animal is a rabbit."
- 「あの動物はウサギだらしい。」 means "It seems that that animal is a rabbit."
- 「そうだ」 cannot be applied to regular nouns (only adjectival nouns)
## 「っぽい」
- also a helper adjective that works like 「らしい」(although a bit more casual)
- cannot be used on logical clauses, only words
- 「らしい」 tends to imply a quality that should be there, although 「っぽい」 tends to imply the opposite
	- ex: 「子供らしい」 means "behaving like a child should" while 「子供っぽい」 means "childish"
