# notes
## sentence structure review
- there are three engines: verb, adjective, and noun + copula
- there are various carriages: nouns and their logical particles
- these can be _mostly_ pared down to three types of words: い engine (adjectives), う engine (verbs), and noun (noun + copula engine and noun + particle carriage)
	- adverbs are almost always a noun or adjective variant
	- most words that are not adjectives or verbs are nouns
## する verbs
- noun + 「する」
	- ex: 「勉強」 means "the act of studying", 「勉強をする」 means "to do the act of studying", and 「勉強する」 means "to study"
## adjectival nouns
- usually called "な adjectives" even though they never stop being nouns
- ex: 「綺麗」 can be used as 「綺麗だ」 or as 「綺麗な」 (with 「な」 being the connective form of 「だ」) to describe something
- some nouns (like 「綺麗」) are almost always used as adjectives and others (like 「元気」) are used as nouns and adjectives with similar frequency
## non-adjectival nouns
- regular nouns can still be used descriptively
	- ex: 「魔法の帽子」 means "magic hat"
		- 「魔法」 is not an adjectival noun, but it can be used to a similar effect
## な vs. の
- 「不思議な国」 means "mysterious country" (descriptive) while 「不思議の国」 means "country of wonder" (attributive)
## なる nouns
- contraction of 「のある」 where 「の」 is taking the place of 「が」
	- 「華麗なる探偵」
	- 「華麗のある探偵」
	- 「華麗がある探偵」
	- which means "detectives possessing splendor"
- can sound a bit more old-fashioned
- 「XなるY] means "a Y possessing X"
## たる nouns
- contraction of 「とある」
- the thing being described exists in a way implied by the noun
- 「XたるY] means "Y existing in an X-like way"
## groups of kanji
- kanji can be used descriptively without any of the mentioned connectors
	- ex: 「日本」 + 「語」 = 「日本語」
	- ex: 「本」 + 「棚」 = 「本棚」
	- ex: 「大学」 + 「教育」 = 「大学教育」
