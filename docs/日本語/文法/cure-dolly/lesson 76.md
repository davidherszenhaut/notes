# notes
- 「開く」 can be pronounced as either 「あく」 or 「ひらく」 depending on the context (the same applies for 「開ける」)
- 「開く」 (「あく」) (self-move) and 「開ける」 (other-move) both mean "to open"
- 「開く」 (「ひらく」) is more used for "unfolding"
- these words have different implications
	- ex: 「お店をあける。」 is more like "opening a store in the morning as usual" while 「お店をひらく。」 is more like "opening a store for the first time"
- 「ひらく」 is both self-move and other move
- 「ひらける」 is more to the self-move side
