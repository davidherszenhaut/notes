# notes
- when 「見る」 is added to the て form of another verb, it mean to try doing the verb (more literally do the verb and see what happens)
- the の particle can be used without specifying the second noun
	- ex: 「彼の車」("his car") and 「彼の」 ("his (object)") can both be used ((object) will be filled in depending on the context)
- there are two particles that can be used to "and" things together
	- the と particle is for exclusive "and"s
	- the や particle is for non-exclusive "and"s
- the から particle means "from"
