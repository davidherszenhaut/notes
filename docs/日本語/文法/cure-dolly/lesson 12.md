# notes
## the と particle
- the と particle can be used like "and" and it can also be used for quotation
- the と particle effectively takes what is being quoted and turns it into a single noun
- common verbs that follow the と particle are 「言う」, 「考える」, and 「思う」
- japanese uses a lot of doubled words as sound effects (ex: 「ピョンピョン」 is the sound of something small jumping) and these also use the と particle
## compound verbs
- japanese commonly uses the い stem of one verb to attach to another verb to give extra meaning
	- ex: 「通る」 means "to pass through", 「過ぎる」 means "to exceed", and 「通り過ぎる」 means "to pass by"
	- ex: 「走る」 means "to run", 「出す」 means "to take out", and 「走り出す」 means "to break out in a run"
## other notes
- japanese has two common words for thing
	- 「もの」 is for more concrete things
	- 「こと」 is for more abstract things
