# notes
- two ways to consider subjective state
	- world acting on me
		- reaction produced in me by external stimulus
	- me acting on world
		- reaction produced by me to external stimulus
- the helper adjective 「たい」 can "flip its polarity" to point to the actor experiencing the desire and not the object inducing desire
	- ex: 「０が早く食べたい。」
	- ex: 「０が東京に行きたい。」 means "(I) want to go to Tokyo."
		- there is no other possible 「０が」 than "I"
- the potential form can also "flip its polarity"
	- ex: 「本が読める。」 means "The book is readable.", but 「私が読める。」 means "I am able to read."
- 「不思議」 means "mystery"
	- it can be used as an adjectival noun (ex: 「不思議な屋敷」 means "mysterious mansion")
	- it can be used with 「そう」 (ex: 「不思議そう」 means "seems mysterious" or "mystified")
