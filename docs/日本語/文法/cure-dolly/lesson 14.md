# notes
## adverbs
- positional expressions (ex: 「うえ」 and 「そば」) are nouns
- 「喋るウサギを見たことがない。」
	- 「喋る」 describes 「ウサギ」
	- 「喋るウサギを見た」 describes 「こと」
	- "The thing of having seen a talking rabbit does not exist."
- to turn an adjective into an adverb, change the い to a く
	- ex: 「早い」 -> 「早く」
- to turn a noun into an adverb, attach に
	- ex: 「静かに歩く」 means "to walk quietly"
- there are some words that are adverbs on their own
	- ex: 「ゆっくり」
## the も particle
- も is a non-logical particle that marks a topic like は
- the topic of the conversation changes to what も marks
- も says that the comment on the new topic is the same as the previous topic
- は is used to draw a distinction
