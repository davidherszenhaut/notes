# notes
## the ０が
- sometimes, the A car of the core japanese sentence is "invisible"
- when the A car is invisible, it is a zero-pronoun
	- ex: 「０がドリーだ。」 is equivalent to 「ドリーだ。」
- consider 私 to the be the default of ０が, but it can be anything given context
## the を particle
- the を particle attaches to the direct object, the noun to which something is being done
- consider を to be an extra car that gives more information about A or B
- ex: 私がケーキを食べる。
	- the core sentence is just 「私が食べる。」
	- 「ケーキを」 just tells more about the core sentence (specifically about B)
	- this sentence can also be expressed as 「０がケーキを食べる。」
