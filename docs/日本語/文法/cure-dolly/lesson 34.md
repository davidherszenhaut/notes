# notes
- the fundamental sentence consists of an A car (subject) and a B engine (predicate)
	- the A car might not always be visible (the 0が)
- core elements and complete logical clauses can be present without being part of the sentence core
	- in these cases, they are modifying the A and/or B cars
- sentences with more than one logical clause must be connected by a conjunction (the て form, the い stem of a verb, and "normal" conjunctions like "if", "when", "and", "but", etc.)
	- ex: 「傘を持ってくればよかった。」 has two clauses connected by 「れば」
		- 「０が傘を持って来」 means "(I) bring an umbrella." (made past tense later by the B engine)
		- 「れば」 means "if"
		- 「０がよかった」 means "(It) would have been good." ("It" referring to the situation)
## finding the end of a logical clause
- the main logical clause is always the last one
- a sentence must always end with an adjective, a verb, or a copula (sentence-ending particles notwithstanding)
- a logical clause within a sentence will also end with an adjective, a verb, or a copula plus a connector
- ex: 「私が彼に話した日本語が出来る留学生は五輪金メダルを獲得した女性と結婚した。」
	- 「私が彼に話した」 means "I spoke to/told him"
		- this is not a complete logical clause because it is followed by a noun (「日本語」) and not a conjunction/て form/い stem
	- 「日本語が出来る」 means "japanese is possible"
		- this is not a complete logical clause for the same reason
		- this is modifying 「留学生」 ("a foreign-exchange student for whom japanese is possible")
		- 「私が彼に話した」 is modifying all of 「日本語が出来る留学生」 ("the japanese-speaking exchange student who I told him about)
	- 「五輪金メダルを獲得した」
		- 「五輪金メダル」 means an olympic (five-ring) gold medal
		- this is not a complete logical clause because there is no doer (this is all describing 「女性」)
	- 「と結婚した」
		- this is the head verb of the sentence
	- "The japanese-speaking exchange student I told him about got married with the olympic gold medal winning girl."
