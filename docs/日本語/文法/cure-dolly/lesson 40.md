# notes
## the other 「で」
- the 「で」 particle signifies that its attached noun is where something took place or the means by which an action was done
- there is another non-particle 「で」
- ex: 「田中さん綺麗で優しい。」 means "Tanaka-san is clean and kind."
	- 「綺麗」 is an adjectival noun
	- 「花が綺麗だ。」 means "The flower is pretty."
	- 「綺麗な花。」 means "The pretty flower."
	- 「花が綺麗で。」 means "The flower is pretty _and..._"
	- need to use the て form of 「だ」 to make a connection because adjectival nouns need to use the copula
- ex: 「お元気で。」 means "Be well."
	- this is using the て form of the copula as a command
- ex: 「無事でよかった。」 means "Good that you weren't hurt."
	- this is using the て form of the copula as a connection
## the other 「が」
- the 「が」 particle is the one particle that is required in every subject to mark the A car
- the other 「が」 is (usually contrasting) clause connector
- ex: 「お店に行ったがパンがなかった。」 means "I went to the store, but there was no bread."
- the particle 「が」 can only ever mark a noun and comes _within_ a logical clause while the conjunctive 「が」 can only ever come _after_ a logical clause
- the conjunctive 「が」 is not always contrasting
- the conjunctive 「が」 can be used a sentence ender
	- the sentence is not technically complete, but the following clause is implied
	- 「が」 at the end of the sentence is more polite than 「けど」 or 「でも」
	- ex: 「コーヒーが欲しいが。」 means "Coffee is want-making to me, but..."
## the other 「に」
- the 「に」 particle is the targeting particle
- the other 「に」 works similarly to 「と」 as an "and"
- this 「に」 is more common in written Japanese
- this 「に」 is also used in the expression 「それに」 ("furthermore" or "in addition")
