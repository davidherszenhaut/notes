# notes
## formal japanese
- 「ます」 is a helper verb that attaches to the い stem
	- it does not change the meaning of the verb, it just makes it formal
	- it is irregular
		- the negative is 「ません」
		- the past negative is 「ませんでした」 (using the past tense of 「です」)
- 「です」 is the formal version of 「だ」 copula
	- 「です」 can be attached to い adjectives to make it formal, but has no grammatical purpose
	- 「ないです」 can be used as a negative formal
## the volitional form
- the volitional form invokes a will to do something
	- differs from 「たい」 which expresses desire
- in godan verbs, the volitional helper is う and attaches to the お stem
- in ichidan verbs, the volitional helper is よう
- 「ます」 becomes 「ましょう」
- 「だ」 becomes 「だろう」 and 「です」 becomes 「でしょう」, putting these at the end of a sentence carries a meaning of "probably"
