## the amount of light reaching the camera's sensor
# practical uses
- opening the [aperture](aperture.md) increases exposure (but reduces depth of field)
- slowing the [shutter speed](shutter-speed.md) increases exposure (but introduces motion blur)
- [iso](iso.md) is sensitivity to light and works like gain
- adjusting one of these values of exposure will require compensation in one (or both) of the other two values to maintain the same level of exposure
- aperture, shutter speed, and iso together are referred to as "the exposure triangle"
