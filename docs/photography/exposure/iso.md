## "the measure of a photographic film's sensitivity to light"
# how iso works
- the signal gain of the light sensor can be arbitrarily adjusted
# practical uses
- in general, try to keep iso as low as possible
- higher iso values can allow for faster shutter speeds in low light conditions at the expense of noise or graining
