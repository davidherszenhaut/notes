## "a hole or an opening that primarily limits light propagated through the system"
# how aperture works
- optical systems usually have many openings/structures called "stops" that limit light rays
- "aperture stop" is the main stop that controls the cone of light rays that an optical system accepts
- "diaphragms" are usually used to control the aperture stop in cameras
- "f-number" is the ratio of focal length to aperture diameter
- increasing the aperture size (decreasing the f-number) allows more light to reach the sensor
- reducing the aperture size (increasing the f-number) allows less light to reach the sensor
- "depth of field" is the distance between the closest and farthest objects that are in focus in an image
- increasing the aperture size decreases the depth of field
- reducing the aperture size increases the depth of field
# practical uses
- lower f-numbers are better for getting blur around a subject
- higher f-numbers are better for getting everything in focus
