# how aperture works
- optical systems usually have many openings/structures called _stops_ that limit light rays
- _aperture stop_ is the main stop that controls the cone of light rays that an optical system accepts
- _diaphragms_ are usually used to control the aperture stop in cameras
- _f-number_ is the ratio of focal length to aperture diameter
- increasing the aperture size (decreasing the f-number) allows more light to reach the sensor
- reducing the aperture size (increasing the f-number) allows less light to reach the sensor
- _depth of field_ is the distance between the closest and farthest objects that are in focus in an image
- increasing the aperture size decreases the depth of field
- reducing the aperture size increases the depth of field
# practical uses
- lower f-numbers are better for getting blur around a subject
- higher f-numbers are better for getting everything in focus
